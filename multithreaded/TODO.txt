We could do more here! If you want to continue enhancing this project, here are some ideas:

1. Use ThreadPool to perform some task other than serving web requests.

2. Find a thread pool crate on crates.io and implement a similar web server using the crate
instead. Then compare its API and robustness to the thread pool we implemented.
