We could do more here! If you want to continue enhancing this project, here are some ideas:

1. Add more documentation to ThreadPool and its public methods.

2. Change calls to unwrap to more robust error handling.

3. Use ThreadPool to perform some task other than serving web requests.

4. Find a thread pool crate on crates.io and implement a similar web server using the crate
instead. Then compare its API and robustness to the thread pool we implemented.
